# 🚀 SkillConnect – Freelance Services & Skill Matching Platform

SkillConnect is a full-stack web platform built to connect **recruiters** and **skilled freelancers** through a smart, feature-rich, and interactive system.  
Designed and developed as part of my **Infosys Springboard Internship (Python Technology Stack)**, this project showcases practical experience in backend development, frontend integration, REST APIs, UI/UX workflows, and real-world job–talent matching systems.

## 🌐 Overview

SkillConnect functions as a **two-sided marketplace**, addressing the needs of:

👔 **Recruiters** – who want to post jobs, review applications, shortlist candidates, and manage hiring  
🧑‍💻 **Freelancers** – who search for opportunities, apply for jobs, and track their applications  

The platform includes personalized dashboards, complete job management, application workflow, and notification support to ensure a smooth hiring experience.
